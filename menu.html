    <h3 style="color: black;">Hello Professor and class, potential clients and employers. My name is Kenisha Nooks and I have put together some web pages using basic HTML to structure the page, CSS to style, color, and design the page, and JavaScript to handle events and control the behavior of the page, along with jQuery to add interactivity on the pages.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: hotpink;">The theme of these pages are to be bold and creative. I chose these colors because they are loud, playful, and inviting.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: cyan;">Navigation menu - is presented on every page with all page links and the ability to navigate to each and every page accordingly. There is also footer with the home link to take you back to the home page. There are also privacy links, regulation links, and educational programming links in the footer. There is a logo in the top left corner of the header that links back to the home page.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: yellow;">About page - includes interactivity about how to use some of the elements on the page and a brief introduction about me.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: blue;">Gallery page - consists of images demonstrating the fundamentals of a Web Developer/Designer which are placed in an overlay gallery navigator where they can also become a slideshow.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Career page - is a simple fun form page you can interact with by filling out the form to include the information being asked. **This form does include minimal error handling with error messages displaying to input the required information.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center"><img src="_images/IIIlogo.jpg"></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: lightpink;">FAQ page - provides full interactivity with several different elements throughout and some fun education about JavaScript. **The form on this page does not provide validation.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: #333;">Product page - includes one of the products listed for potential sale as a Web Developer or Designer. This page does not include interaction but the navigation for the product link is interactive as a second level link to the products page.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: black;">Services link in the navigation is just a link and is not opened or usable. Just for demonstration purposes.</h3>
    <h3 style="color: black;">Locations link in the navigation is just a link and is not opened or usable. Just for demonstration purposes, but does include menu interactivity that displays three levels of a dropdown menu.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: hotpink;">Contact page - is a full interactive form to signup to the website. This form does include error messages along the way for the user to enter required information or correct format of the form. **This form also includes validation and processes the form which you will see when the form is completed. You can also return to the home page from the process form at the bottom of the page in the footer.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: cyan;">References page - includes a list of sources to all the images that I used in this project. It This page is also linked to the navigation menu as well as the footer of every page.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color: yellow;">As you will see, JavaScript not only adds functionality to a web page, but it allows you to make them interactive, thanks to jQuery.</h3>
